Removes some of the limits around item enchanting.

Items can have more than one enchantment on them.

Items can have duplicate enchantments on them.

This does not change any of the requirements for enchanting recipes.

All enchantment effects should display in the details page but currently they all display under the one enchantment name

I've only really done a minimal amount of testing to confirm basic functionality so consider this to be beta/wip for the time being.
